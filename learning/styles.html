    <h1>About</h1>
    <section class="wq">
        <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat"[10] is the founder and captain
            of
            the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top
            fighters.[26][27] He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby
            become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to
            Shanks,
            his brothers, and crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the
            world.[31]

            Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,[32] and
            the
            grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[33], where their family carries the initial of D. At age 7,
            Luffy
            accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber.[34] Shanks also gave Luffy the very
            straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for
            them
            to meet again someday after he became a great pirate.[35] Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly
            Dadan,[36] Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace[37] and
            Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.[38]

    <h1>Next about</h1>
    <p>Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates
        in
        the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World
        Nobles,
        and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded
        and
        indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal
        figure in
        the Summit War of Marineford. He has also either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or
        present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, Luffy has invaded the territory of
        the
        Four Emperors on multiple occasions and eventually managed to defeat one. Luffy's accomplishments and
        heritage
        have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for
        being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine
        Headquarters, and even the World Government.[39]

        Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw
        Hat
        Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After
        learning of
        this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea,"
        though
        many prominent figures initially considered this to be exaggerated.[40] However, after defeating Kaidou
        during
        the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government
        along
        with Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.[4]

    <h1>Final about</h1>
    Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained
    his
    first bounty of Beli30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then
    increased to
    Beli 100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies
    Lobby,
    his bounty was increased to Beli300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused
    Luffy, along with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the
    Red
    Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.[41] He, the other ten Super Rookies,
    and
    Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."[42]

    Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to Beli400,000,000, he entered the New World and began
    challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to Beli 500,000,000 after the
    Dressrosa
    Arc, and later all the way to Beli1,500,000,000 after the global revelation that he is Sabo's brother and the
    existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet becoming public, as well as the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. After
    leading the Raid on Onigashima and defeating Kaidou, his bounty was increased to Beli 3,000,000,000, placing him
    as
    one of the members of the Four Emperors.</p>
