            Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage,
            unique
            structure, and culture.
            It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical
            bias against the Global South.[8][9] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the
            2000s,
            it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s,[3][8][10][note 4]
            having
            become an important fact-checking site.[11][12] It has been censored by world governments, ranging from
            specific
            pages to the entire site.[13][14]
            Articles on breaking news are often accessed as a source of frequently updated information about those
            events.
